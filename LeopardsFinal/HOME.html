            <h3>
                The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera, a member of the Felidae.[4]
                It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa, in small parts of Western and Central Asia, on the Indian subcontinent to
                Southeast and East Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by habitat
                loss and fragmentation, and are declining in large parts of the global range. In Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuwait, Syria, Libya,
                Tunisia and most likely in Morocco, leopard populations have already been extirpated.[3] Contemporary records suggest that the
                leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical global range.[5][6]

            <h3>
                Leopards are hunted illegally, and their body parts are smuggled in the wildlife trade for medicinal practices and decoration.[7][8]
                Compared to other wild cats, the leopard has relatively short legs and a long body with a large skull. Its fur is marked with rosettes.
                It is similar in appearance to the jaguar, but has a smaller, lighter physique, and its rosettes are generally smaller, more densely packed
                and without central spots. Both leopards and jaguars that are melanistic are known as black panthers. The leopard is distinguished by its
                well-camouflaged fur, opportunistic hunting behaviour, broad diet, strength, and its ability to adapt to a variety of habitats ranging from
                rainforest to steppe, including arid and montane areas. It can run at speeds of up to 58 kilometres per hour (36 mph).[9] The earliest known
                leopard fossils excavated in Europe are estimated 600,000 years old, dating to the late Early Pleistocene.[2] Leopard fossils were also found in Japan.[10]

            <h3>
                A male leopard with an atypical coat pattern (Wilhelma, Germany). Notice that the large rosettes are similar to those of a jaguar.
                The leopard's skin colour varies between individuals from pale yellowish to dark golden with dark spots grouped in rosettes.
                Its belly is whitish and its ringed tail is shorter than its body. Its pupils are round.[19] Leopards living in arid regions are
                pale cream, yellowish to ochraceous and rufous in colour; those living in forests and mountains are much darker and deep golden.
                Spots fade toward the white underbelly and the insides and lower parts of the legs.[20] Rosettes are circular in East African leopard
                populations, and tend to be squarish in Southern African and larger in Asian leopard populations. The fur tends to be grayish in colder
                climates, and dark golden in rain forest habitats.[9] The pattern of the rosettes is unique in each individual.[21][22]

            <h3>
                Its fur is generally soft and thick, notably softer on the belly than on the back.[23] It tends to grow longer in colder climates.[24]
                The guard hairs protecting the basal hairs are short, 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) in face and head, and increase in length toward the flanks
                and the belly to about 25–30 mm (0.98–1.18 in). Juveniles have woolly fur, and appear to be dark-coloured due to the densely arranged
                spots.[25][21] Its white-tipped tail is about 60–100 cm (24–39 in) long, white underneath and with spots that form incomplete bands toward the tail's end.[26]
                The leopard's rosettes differ from those of the jaguar, which are darker and with smaller spots inside. The cheetah has small round spots without any rosettes.[19]
