                A lioness steals a leopard kill in Kruger National Park
                In parts of its global range, the leopard is sympatric with other large predators such as tiger,
                lion, cheetah, spotted hyena, striped hyena, brown hyena, African wild dog, dhole and up to five
                bear species. Some of these species steal its kills, kill its cubs and even kill adult leopards.
                Leopards retreat up a tree in the face of direct aggression, and were observed when killing or
                preying on smaller competitors such as black-backed jackal, African civet, caracal, and African
                wildcat.[9][122] Leopards generally seem to avoid encounters with adult bears, but kill vulnerable
                bear cubs. In Sri Lanka, a few recorded vicious fights between leopards and sloth bears apparently
                result in both animals winding up either dead or grievously injured.[123][124]

                While interspecies killing of full-grown leopards is generally rare, given the opportunity, both tiger and lion
                readily kill and consume both young and adult leopards.[114][122][125][126] In the Kalahari Desert, leopards frequently
                lose kills to brown hyenas, if the leopard is unable to move the kill into a tree. Single brown hyenas have been observed
                charging at and displacing male leopards from kills.[127][128] Lions occasionally fetch leopard kills from trees.[121]

            <h3>
                Leopards have been known to humans throughout history, and have featured in the art, mythology, and folklore of many countries where
                they have historically occurred. In Greek mythology, the leopard was a symbol of the god Dionysus; who was depicted wearing leopard
                skin and using leopards as means of transportation. In one myth, the god was captured by pirates but two leopards appear and rescue him.
                The Ancient Romans kept leopards in captivity to be slaughtered in hunts as well as be used in executions of criminals.[148] During the
                Benin Empire, the leopard was commonly represented on engravings and sculptures and was used to symbolize the power of the king or oba,
                since the leopard was considered the king of the forest. Leopards were also kept and paraded as mascots, totems and sacrifices to deities.[149]

                Most leopards avoid people, but humans may occasionally be targeted as prey. Most healthy leopards prefer wild prey to humans, but injured, 
                sickly, or struggling cats or those with a shortage of regular prey may resort to hunting humans and become habituated to it. Although usually 
                slightly smaller than a human, an adult leopard is much more powerful and easily capable of killing one. Two extreme cases occurred in India: 
                the first leopard, "the Leopard of Rudraprayag", killed more than 125 people; the second, "the Panar Leopard", was believed to have killed more
                than 400. Both were killed by the renowned hunter and conservationist Jim Corbett.[156] Man-eating leopards are considered bold and difficult to
                track and may enter human settlements for prey, more so than lions and tigers.[157] Author and big game hunter, Kenneth Anderson, had first-hand 
                experience with many man-eating leopards, and described them as far more threatening than tigers.
